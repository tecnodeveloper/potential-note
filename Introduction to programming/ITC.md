# Introduction to computing(ITC)

## Professional English

- Speaking english is not such important but Writing english like emails, website content, and other messages must be correctly type in english.
- Don't put space before the comman .like this | put space after the command and fullstop. like this | Captilize whole Abbrivation ITC like this | Its vs It's like this It's always my pleasure
- Don't become much formal to anyone that anyone could even talk to you and don't become much informal that other will think you'r inprofessional Intermediate | Don't use word dear instead use Hi like Hi dennis | Don't write messages by the combination of urdu-english to anyone formal or informal instead write in english.
- Change the youtube algorithm watch tech videos on only on one channel if you want to watch comedy or drama videos go to another account
- Learn from Industry people. Attend Conference, Poster sessions, Workshops
- Never send Resume / CV in editable form like .docx or doc, Send in Universal format PDF [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfYLu97zVoE&list=PLnd7R4Mcw3rKf9H9_sOROaYnqsKp7w50w&index=5]
- Change is constant in life, Do work like you don't know any work except this work, In ocean there is sand, stone, dolphine, sharks and many other things if one thing is not correct than you don't call or hate entire ocean Same example set on social media your brain if you choose good role model persnality, friend circle or you can watch other things on internet and call the internet as villian. Its important that resources need but it is more important to resourceful. Contentment(Satisfaction and happiness) come from internal(inside yourself) Remember its not state that you sit on it long.
- if you have car budget of 10 to 15 lac than don't buy car by taken loan of 50 to 60 lac just to make jealousy your relatives you are solding yourself Please don't buy it, What do people think about you is your biggest regret in old age remember that please don't do it.
- Healthy body has healthy brain Don't take suger and salt too much and remember not to watch videos again it will effect after 20.
- Resoursces are not much important than being resourceful(brother i have to do this without resources). if you don't have resource than don't make excuses to yourself(please).
- It is not resources that you'll lack its resourceful that you lack. Attitude toward resoursefulness is much more important than resources
- If the laptop or computer start but not display its more likely that it is problem in Ram.
- Friendship is not like when you have work or something else then you text message to your friend, and even worse you call them friends thats not defination of friends. Yep there is bad time on anyone and you have to help them This is not called friendship
- If you teach other than you learn something new everytime, Comparison is theif of joy
- Don't say No to any opportunity, give your 100% to the opportunity

## Assumption

- Programming language is like "Egg" "Water" "Heat" Example: first you have to known how to "recipe of boiling" an egg then you can translate the recipe if you don't know how to boil the egg(problem solving) then its not the advantage to learn translation. Programming language does't tell you how to solve the problem.
- Some programmer don't use program development tool like pseudocode They feel that their ultimate goal is to solve the problem on computer and that writing pseudocode merely delays the production of final output. Although this may work for simple and familiar problem, it can lead to serious errors and delay in large, complex project.
- How do you calculate the square root? sqrt(36) or sqrt(35) first take assumption(means our program solve which kind of problem) then write algorithms if the problem is new to you then write start write pseudocode.
- Programmer must take assumption first then write program, Assumption is on Output(interface) means user must input no between these numbers otherwise the program will be break that every number that is input by user must be assumption of programmer that user cannot put in (-) or exceed the maximum number avoids.
- Problem solving technique is not writing the code, its about farmulizing the problem in algorithms and then by using translater(programming language) convert into program.

## ITC

- Date 03/12/2024 starting date of course.
- Was CS your first choice? If not CS, what was?
    Yup, I love the field of CS, everything is changing in the computer science field after every second. New things to learn everyday. Its like marthon of seeking knowledge which never gets ending.
- What do you want to do after BS?
    I want to do job or internship after CS in web development. To do this i need to get high grade CGPA + enhance skill of BS.
- Typing skill very important, So learn typing from start semester 1
    1. Typing skill
    2. sal;Docker
    3. Communication and presentation skill
- Move to linux its really helpfull for programmer or for many other reason or use it by vmware, virtual-box
- How request are handled from computer to server
- DNS stand for domain name system, it is userful for human to remember the name of website but backend they have ip addresses or physical address called MAC address
- OS are the souls of computer operating sytem do System calls and Application Programming Interface
- if the Operating system communicate with application then they use system call or API, if the application communicate with another application then they use application API(Application programming interface)
- Cluster computing and grid computing put several computer togeather to create extremely powerful functions(Did't use today)
- Use combinations of functions and classes in program(OOP best practice)
- Containers (See Docker) are light weight virtual machine, Create once, Deploy everywhere
- Also, Businesses can't rely fully on other businesses for their operations, Cloud computing there are concerns as well as those related to security and privacy issue for cloud computing that it can sell your customer charges or it can raise the fees.
- Developer Sandbox -> QA -> production Write two number addition program( -2-4 = 6), Update yourself with technology
- Memory, Register, instructions, parameters Registers are the fastest memory in computer, integrated in processor and there are name of registers ax, bx, cx, dx, Registers are 15 to 17 in computer, Currently performed instruction memory used by processor are stored in register
- Machine Language  -> 0010 00 010   First instruction(+, -, *, /) than parameter(0, 6) are written in statement in ml.
- Assembly language -> Add  0  6
- Syntax (Rules of programming called Syntax) string s = 45; --> syntax error(Rule break of programming)
- Static Semantic if syntactically valid statements have any meaning(I saw a cat, I cat dog)
- Semantic or dynamic semantic Meaning statement can make sense (I saw dog, I saw dinosaurs) you need knowledge outside the programming to correct this computer cannot correct this.

1. Crash (program crashes window blue death screen) 36/0
2. Run to infinity (Program running again and again and could not stop) Loop problem
3. Run and produce an output(without assurance of correctness) Let's eat grandpa -> Let's eat, grandpa, Software testing

## Categorizations of languages

- Low-level vs High level (High level is more understandable by humans and low level is difficult to understand by humans but easy for computers)
- General vs domain specific (language written to solve problems in particular domain : Sql is used for only database scope -> domain specific) and (General purpose languages are created to solve problems in many domains)
- Interpreted vs compiled

 1. Source code
 2. Machine code

- Meta Data means data about data In file manager there is meta data that tells file is modified this date it store this date, data size.

## Python

- High level
- General purpose
- Interpreted
- Scripts(depend on libraries small source code to write program), programs(self contained independend), shell(Read Evaluate Print Loop command line interface)
- Anaconda is a distribution of python
- Difference between python and c++ is double quotes and single quotes are same but not in c++
- If you want to write multi-line string then write three double quotes """    Multiline string     """
- AND is like multiplication, OR is like addition of 0 and 1 in algebra.
- small boxes are called functions and collection of small boxes are called packeges, library and module, Module import math is collection of functions called module or library
- Brain use in writing algorithm now the translation from algorithm to programming is very easy(typing).
- C++ you can't change the type of datatype but in python you can change the type of variable(a = 12, a = "abc").
- Python ma semicollon nahi hai but in C++ must be semicollon at the end of statement.
- String can be multiplied in python but in C++ you can't do string data type.
- Importing variable from libraries like pi #define pi 3.14 in c++ and in python you can import from math library
- Two piece of code are written there output will be same but there if there is difference in source code of first will understand very quickly then the code with understand quickly will consider more to best pragram rather than old fashion code.
- people don't read the error So best practice is to read error completely with tongue then think about error. First of all read what type of error in upper side
- You can change the name of built-in function in python like f = sqrt but not in c++.
- Print takes operand to output and put spaces between operand in c++ you use cout<< to print output on output screen

`def square(x):
    return x * x`

- def means define square means name of function (parameters) means input from calling function collon after it four spaces means function body if the intendation is over than the function body is over
- Argument sent copy value to parameter not the variable it sent value parameter Actual parameter send the value to formal parameter they don't send the variable name So don't worry if they have same name
- Defualt parameter are those if you input value then it take value otherwise if you don't give value they will take defualt value
- In python '#' is used to write comment. In C++ you use two forward slash or slash to comment, Statement line must be end by putting semicollon at the end of every statement But in python you can end statement by stop typing. Using global variable is bad practice.
- if takes binary value TRUE or FALSE on the basis of it execute if body
- Fibonacci number fib(n) = fib(n-1) + fib(n-2) Fibonacci spiral is called golden spiral where the eye mostly focus attention
- Changing the algorithm will change the speed of program (Analysis of algorithm)
- Indentation, spaces, reuseable code will not effect the speed of compiler but it effect when other programmer reads your code. So indent code give spaces and comment where needed.
- A sequences is an ordered collection of values

1. Array(C++) , List(Python)
2. String
3. range(python)

- C++ arrays are similar to Python lists with one key difference: arrays must contain elements of the same data type, lists can include elements of different types.
- First do your program dry run reading before execution it will correct your program if there is any error, Dry run reading, Dry run writing(Logic building)
- Programmer are very lazy, You will notice in any language mostly used built-in function syntax name are small compared to those used less they have large syntax name.(Programming design)
- Good practice of nested loop is first write inner loop than write outer loop.
- list-mutable(change) in python is written in [] `digit = [1,2,3,4,5]` and tuple-Immutable(no change) datatype are written in () `digit = (1,2,3,4,5)`
- () is used for function call & [] is used for list data structure & {} is used for dictionaries data structure
- `lst = [1,2,3,4,5]` list are retrieve through their order of index
- Dictionaries are unordered list data-structure and retrieve through key-value(word-meaning) concept, A dictionaries is collection of key-value pairs
`
    {

        "package":            "A package is module that can be added to any progam",
        "random":             "Any data or information that has no order",
        "Unary operation"     "An operator that takes only one value for its operation"

    }
`
- json(javascript object notation) file are made of dictionaries
- `C:\msys64\ucrt64\bin` Absolute path means full path `cd ..` means step back change current directory to back `cd ucrt64\bin` Relative path means path of current directory to file
- Window os uses only backslash(\) and linux and other os uses frontslash or slash(/), Window root point start from letter directory C: and other os root point is slash /, window said folder and other os said directory
- Lets say we write program in window(\) than directory error may occur when mac user run program(/) but python solve this problem by `import os`
- CSV stand for Comma Separated Value
- ZeroDivisionError is an assumption of programmer that user may input denomenator by 0 So using try catch Exceptional handling you can easily tackle this problem, Using try-catch block you handle exception which is not routine case called exceptional handling.
- Now we programmer raise exception by taking assumption and printing error, exception is top heirechy of error all errors are cover in the exception

`
    def div(num, den):
    return num / float(den)

try:
    print ("Div 4 by 2 is:", div(4,0))
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Don't divide by 0")
except Exception:
    print("All errors are coverd in exception top hierechy")
except ValueError:
    print("This value is incorrect")
`

- You will see application written on github are in different languages 21% C++ 40% python 4% javascript, Do advance in one language and learn other language also later but first practice and master one language called **Polyglot**
- Multiple languages interacting with each other in software. Android games interface are made in java but engine backend written in C/C++ java call or interect with C/C++.
- static means fixed(no change) while dynamic mean capable of change. C++ is Statically data type language and python is dynamic language, C++ is medium level language, Python is high level language.
- When you want to write main() on top of program and functions below then you have to declare the function before the main()

`

    int variable_test(int p);   // <-- function prototype

    int main()
    {
        int a = 12;
        variable_test(20);     //function call
    }
    int variable_test(int p)
    {
        p = p * p;
        return p;             //Where the function calls it will return value of p
    }
`

- Overflow error occur in data type in c++ when you assign value to int that is bigger than its storing capacity

`

    int main()
    {
        int a = INT_MAX;
        cout<< a <<endl;
        a = a + 1;                   //Overflow
        cout<< a <<endl;
    }
`

- ASCII value store 255 symbols but Unicode is collection of all thousand of symbols of world languages in unicode, Latest languages by defualt switches to Unicode, Old language support ASCII as well Unicode.
- When you create application you will write in unicode so it will runs all over the world japan, chinese language.
- We use int as boolean in C++, Basic rule: if treat 0 as false and all other number are true.

`

    int v = 0;

    if(v)    <-- v == 0 means false
        cout<<"v is true! ";
    else     <-- any no other than 0 is true
        cout<<"v is false";
`

- if-else, while, for, loop all will evalute first condition and then they take only true or false
- ` return; ` will stop the execution of program no lines after return statement executed
- if the condition become false in first AND ` ( 0 && 1 ) ` it will skip 1 and return 0 called short circuit in boolean expression
- if the condition become true in first OR ` ( 1 || 0 ) ` it will skip 0 and return 1 called short circuit in boolean expression
- binary take 2 operand ` operand && operand `  ternary operator take 3 operand ` operand ? operand : operand `  we break the operator in two pieces ` ?: ` is called ternary operator ` A  ? B : C ` The A must be condition like if it take true or false
- It is highly recommend that don't use ` i++ or ++i ` operator in code. it create lot of semantic bugs. same as ` i += 1 `
- In Professional programming array is very less use array and list words are interchangeable in C++ programming, but they are not same
- Array has fixed size but list can append, Array store only same data type element but list can store different type of datatype elements.
- So problem solved by list in python cannot solve by array in c++ we use list in c++.
- You have to clean or release memory of sensitive data(credit, password) in the end of program.
- Use functions rather than writing code in main() function. (programming tip)
- We want to define the structure(ڈھانچہ) of student then we can make our own datatype by using structure

`

    struct student{    <--  student is datatype
        int rollno;
        float marks;
    };

    student s1;
    student s2;

    s1.rollno = 1
    s1.marks = 12.34;

    s2.rollno = 2
    s2.marks = 10.4;
    cout<<"Student 1 marks and rollno: "  <<s1.rollno<<s1.marks;

    student s[5];
    s[0]

`

- When function create in c++ the compiler first intialize all the variable and give them values

`
    int x = 2;
    int *p;     <--* means follow the address forward variable pointer dereferencing
    p = &x;  <-- & means print the address and store in pointer(So pointer is nothing just storing address of memory)

`

- Memory address of array ` A ` is same as first element of ` &A[0] `
- Array element store in memory in contigious form.
- Java is purely oop based. java program start with class.
- Passing by value sent the value as argument.(changes made on argument does't effect x)
- Passing by reference/address send the address as argument it break rule of abstraction.(changes made on argument effects the x)
- When we print array name only it give us address

`

int main()
{
    int A[] = {1,2,3,4,5};
    cout<<"Adress of array: "<< A << endl;     <-- It give us address of array or address of 1st element.
    cout<<"Adress of array 1st element: "<< &A[0] << endl;
    if( A == &A[0] )  cout<<"Equal address";
    return 0;
}

`

- dot(.) operator has higher precedence than astric(*) So we use brackets to increase precedence of astric ` (*p.)  is equivalent to  p-> `

`

    struct student{    <--  student is datatype
        int rollno;
        float marks;
    };

    student s1;
    student s2;

    s1.rollno = 1
    s1.marks = 12.34;

    s2.rollno = 2
    s2.marks = 10.4;
    cout<<"Student marks: "  << s1.marks <<endl;

    int *sptr;
    *sptr = s1;

    //cout<<"Student marks: "  << *sptr.marks << endl;    . operator has higher precedence so first . execute means(go inside the pointer)
    cout<<"Student marks: "  << (*sptr).marks << endl;

    cout<<"Student marks: "  << sptr->marks << endl;   // sptr->marks is equal to  (*sptr).marks
    student s[5];
    s[0]
    
`

- Cammel case ` int rollNumber `  vs title case ` int RollNumber ` vs underscore convention ` int Roll_No ` both are valid but mostly cammel case is used.
- Static is instance of class.
- In Overloading the function prototype is different but In overriding the function prototype(signature) is same
- When parent function is same as child function prototype then parent function is ovride and compiler use child function called overriding.
- logs are very important in every field of development. If software crashes we want to known in which part software crash from user device so we put different print statement in different function to easily find bugs(logging). ` import logging `

`
    ERROR
    WARN   --> warning
    INFO   --> information
    DEBUG

`

- Plotting stuff in python is used by import numpy

`

    import numpy as np   <-- we use shortcut np
    x = np.linspace(0,10,40)
    print x

`

- testing in python is very simple. testing code function must start with ` test_ `
- Every execution of statement is called step | step into means go inside the function and show execution of every function body | step over means just give the output of function body | breakpoint stop the program and show the current state of program(Debugging)
- ` __init__ ` is like constructor in python.
