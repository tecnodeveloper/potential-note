# Linux & Git/Github

- Linux was created by developer linux torvalds

## Choosing Linux Distribution

- Linux kernal is core of opreating system. It manages the hardware and tells it how to interact with system.
- So first of lets choose linux distribution. Every linux distribution uses different package manager. Mostly two distribution debian and red hat distribution.
- Debian use "apt"(Advanced package Tool). Debian is extremely stable "core" operating system because it does't get latest updates.
- Ubuntu is debian based developed by "canonical". So it uses debian package manager "apt"(advanced package tool). It give you greate GUI interface and good choice for beginner. It is widely used and supported by window(WSL).
- Linux Mint is base of ubuntu. if you prefer light-weight distribution than ubuntu use linux mint. it is light-weight and use debian package manager "apt".
- Arch linux is similar to debian based. Arch user rolling release model so incremental update become stable release. It uses its own package manager "pacman".

---------------

- Red hat Enterprise linux use different package manager "rpm". It's mostly used in enterprise and thus its has paid version also. Red hat enterprise have solid server os.
- fedora is backed by Red hat Fedora get the latest update testing then it will apply to Red hat enterprise. Think fedora as Ubuntu equivalent that use Red hat backened instead of debian. Fedora use "rpm" if you want to use free red hat enterprise use fedora.
- openSUSE is great choice for new linux user. It offer installer/administration application(YaST). and uses RPM package manager.

---------------

- If you just started linux and you want difficult path. I'd choose Gentoo, Arch linux. Gentoo is for advanced user and provide flexibility with OS.

## The Shell

- Shell is program that take commands and send them to OS. In GUI you have seen "Terminal" or "Console" these are program that launch shell for you.
- In linux we use "bash" (Bourne again shell) almost all linux distribution will defualt to bash shell `username@hostname:current_directory` like ubunutu     `recluzedev@RECLUZEDEV:~$`. The $ for normal user of bash(bourne again shell)
- echo command just print out or display the text argument on the console `echo Hello World`.

## pwd(print working directory)

- pwd just show you in which directory you are in. The path start from root folder.
- Everything in linux is file. Every file is organized in hierarchical directory tree. The first directory named as `root` directory. root directory display with `/` forward slash in linux. The root folder has many files and folders.















## Git & Github

- git is a software to manage github, github is online service.
- git --version tells the version of software (git bash where you can run linux command as well)
- Repositries is like folder name. local git repo is different from github repo
- git status tells the repositries are tracked or not tracked
- git add . means add all folder to git repo but if it give any error then go inside folder and delete .git hidden folder.
